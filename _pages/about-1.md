I'm a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Department of Computing + Mathematical Sciences, <a href="https://www.cms.caltech.edu/"> Caltech</a> since January, 2024. Prior to this, I worked at Google in USA as a full-time visiting faculty researcher (Scientist) in 2023. I was an Postdoc Researcher (2021 - 2023) at  the School of Computation, Information and Technology, <a href="https://www.tum.de/en">Technical University of Munich</a>, Germany, working with [Prof. Stefan Leutenegger](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/leutenegger-stefan).  I was an academic guest (2019 - 2021) in the [Computer Vision and Geometry Group](https://cvg.ethz.ch/) (CVG), at ETH  Zurich, Switzerland, working with [Prof. Marc Pollefeys](http://people.inf.ethz.ch/pomarc/). I was also a visiting scholar (2018) in the [Robot Perception and Navigation Group](http://sites.udel.edu/robot) (RPNG) of [Prof. Guoquan (Paul) Huang](https://udel.edu/~ghuang/) at University of Delaware, USA, and a visiting scholar (2017) in the [UTS Robotics Institute](https://www.uts.edu.au/research/robotics-institute), University of Technology Sydney, Australia, working with [Prof. Teresa Vidal Calleja](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Teresa.VidalCalleja). I received my doctoral degree in 2021, from the Department of Control Science and Engineering at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), China, under the co-supervision of [Prof. Guoquan (Paul) Huang](https://udel.edu/~ghuang/) and [Prof. Yong liu](https://april.zju.edu.cn/team/dr-yong-liu/),  and graduated with honors. Previously, I graduated with honors and obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2016.

I'm open to collaborations on cutting-edge research about robotic perception and intelligence, and co-supervise highly-qualified students. Feel free to reach out through [email](mailto:zuox@caltech.edu)!

<h2>research interests</h2>
My research interests include robotics perception, 3D computer vision,  multi-sensor fusion, state estimation, and foundation models.  

I'm conducting research on integrating the intelligence of the deep neural networks and the traditional probabilistic methods for real-time robotic perception tasks.
